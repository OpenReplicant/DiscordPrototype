This is a POC project to help everyone build advanced interactive chat bots.

It works with discord right now, has NLP.js setup for one intent (send selfie), and some !commands. Direct messages are supported, not setup for chatrooms/groups. First user interaction creates a directory titled as their discord ID under /user where chatlog and character data are stored. Each user can have a custom character this way.

Emojis and images sent to the bot are captioned for their reaction.

Will make this bot available on Discord. Check back soon.
